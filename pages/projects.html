                    <p>
                        This typing game demonstrates low-level programming
                        expertise by implementing an interactive arcade
                        experience entirely in x86 Assembly Language. Linked
                        with the Irvine Library, the project features dynamic
                        word generation, adjustable game speed, and a polished
                        user interface inspired by the popular ZType game.
                        Players race against falling words, testing both their
                        typing accuracy and speed. The project showcases my
                        ability to work with hardware-level programming concepts
                        including memory management, real-time input handling,
                        and graphics rendering—all without the abstractions of
                        high-level languages.

                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        This graphing calculator showcases low-level systems
                        programming and algorithm implementation in C++. Built
                        from the ground up with custom linked-list-based Stack
                        and Queue data structures, it uses the Shunting Yard
                        algorithm to parse complex mathematical expressions and
                        converts them to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) for
                        efficient evaluation. The SFML graphics library powers
                        real-time visualization, rendering smooth function plots
                        as users input equations. This project demonstrates
                        strong fundamentals in data structures, parsing
                        algorithms, and graphics programming—all without relying
                        on high-level abstractions or libraries for core
                        functionality.

                        Record-tables showcases end-to-end systems programming
                        in modern C++. The project implements a minimal but
                        functional database engine that processes SQL-like
                        queries through a sophisticated pipeline: a tokenizer
                        breaks down user input, a shunting-yard parser converts
                        expressions to Reverse Polish Notation, and an RPN
                        evaluator executes queries over B+ tree-indexed data
                        stored in binary files. What makes this project stand
                        out is its from-scratch implementation of core data
                        structures—including a B+ tree for logarithmic-time
                        lookups, doubly linked lists, stacks, and queues—without
                        relying on STL containers for the engine core.

                    <p>
                        This project showcases my ability to work at the
                        hardware-software interface by implementing a calculator
                        entirely in Assembly language. Rather than relying on
                        high-level abstractions, I manually handled number
                        conversions between ASCII and BCD formats, implemented
                        arithmetic operations at the bit level, and managed
                        memory directly. This project demonstrates not just
                        programming skill, but a deep understanding of how
                        computers process data at the most fundamental
                        level—perfect for roles requiring systems programming,
                        embedded development, or performance-critical
                        applications.
